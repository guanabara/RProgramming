Compactly display the internal structure of an R object

rnorm - generate random Normal variables with a given mean and standard deviation
dnorm - evaluate the Normal probability density (with given mean/SD) at a point (or vector of points)
pnorm - evaluate the cumulative distribution function for a Normal distribution
rpois - generate random Poisson variates with a given rate

set.seed ensures reproducibility (reproduce numbers that have been already generated)

system.time() - tells you the amount of time R takes evaluating an expression

Using Rprof():
	- should not be used with system.time()
	- summaryRprof() function sumarizes the output from Rprof() (otherwise its not readable)	
		o by.total divides the time spend in each function by total run time
		o by.self does the same but first subtracts out time spent in functions above in the call stack
